### Hi there 👋 I'm [Jason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonflorentino/), a full-stack developer.

🚀👨‍💻🪖⚡️  
**I'm also a career-changer, self-taught programmer, bootcamp grad, and on a mission to teach myself computer science.**

💼 I'm currently working as a teaching assistant for BrainStation's full-stack bootcamp.  
🔭 I like to follow my nose, continually building things that might help others, and picking up new skills to along the way.  
🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Diving deeper into React  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Furthering my backend skills with Node. Python is up next.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Data Structures & Algorithms with Tim Roughgarden's Stanford Algorithms lectures and various books  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • How a computer works with Bryant and O'Hallaron's *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*  
💫 Fun fact: I used to be an ad agency art director for brands like KFC and LG.
